The rise of open data initiatives means that there is an increasing amount of raw data available.
At the same time, the general public increasingly distrusts statistics and “post-truth” has been
chosen as the word of 2016. The objective of The Gamma project is to help reverse this
development. We argue that an important part of the problem is the fact that data science is
often opaque, non-experts find results difficult to interpret and verify, and creating data-driven
reports is limited to a small number of specialists.

We aim to address this problem by building novel programming tools that make it easy for journalists
to build open, transparent data-driven reports and encourage interested citizens to understand how
the presented claims are justified, further explore data and make their own factual claims. We show
that recent ideas from programming language research can dramatically simplify the complexity of
code to perform data access and aggregation and make it possible to automatically provide user
interfaces that enable the readers to modify parameters of data visualizations.
