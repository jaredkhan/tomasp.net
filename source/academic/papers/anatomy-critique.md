The paper by Basman et al. suggests that we think about programming in terms of interaction rather
than algorithms. This call needs to be interpreted in a broad sense – the idea of interaction is not
just another programming abstraction, but different way of structuring our thinking about
programming. This includes thinking about how users can interact with the software more generally,
but also what are effective metaphorical ways of thinking about software.

In this critique, we review some of the core ideas presented by Basman et al. We consider what
programming substrate might be used to implement the systems proposed by Basman et al. That is,
systems that blur the boundaries between users and developers. We also review a number of systems
that are technically similar to co-occurrences and entanglements and we reconsider them through
the perspective of the research paradigm based on interaction
