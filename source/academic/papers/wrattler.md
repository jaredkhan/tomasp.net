Notebooks such as Jupyter became a popular environment for data science, because 
they support interactive data exploration and provide a convenient way of interleaving code, 
comments and visualizations. Alas, most notebook systems use an architecture that leads to a 
limited model of interaction and makes reproducibility and versioning difficult.

In this paper, we present Wrattler, a new notebook system built around provenance that addresses
the above issues. Wrattler separates state management from script evaluation and controls the 
evaluation using a dependency graph maintained in the web browser. This allows richer forms of 
interactivity, an efficient evaluation through caching, guarantees reproducibility and makes it 
possible to support versioning.
