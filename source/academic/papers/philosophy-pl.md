# What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of Science?

 - description:  This essay looks how theories from philosophy of science apply
     to programming language research. I argue that it is important to clearly state research
     programme, avoid early over-emphasis on precision and I consider how to produce truly reusable
     experiments.

As a relatively recent discipline, computer science, and programming language research
in particular, have so far eluded the eyes of philosophers of science. However, we can
gain interesting insights by looking at classical works in philosophy of science and
reconsidering their meaning from the perspective of programming language research.  

This is exactly what I attempt to do in this essay â€“ I will go through some of the most
important theories of science and look what they can say about programming language
research. Then I suggest how we can improve our scientific practice in the light of
these observations.

First, I discuss how understanding the research programme is important for evaluating
scientific contributions. Second, I argue that overemphasis on precise, mathematical
models in early stage of research may limit the creativity. Thirdly, I propose how
to design stand-alone (theory-independent) experiments in program- ming language research
and how this can help to integrate the vast amount of knowledge gathered by
software practitioners.
