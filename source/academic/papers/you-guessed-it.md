We live in times in which information is abundant, but trust in expert analysis is low. How can we
make complex issues accessible for readers and overcome their preconceptions? We propose a novel
way of presenting readers with data and raising awareness for individual bias and preconceptions.

In our application, readers freely choose potentially relevant factors in societally relevant issues
and reflect on their choices in an engaging, non-threatening way. We suggest that such an approach
allows for more engaged and open-minded readers and as a result can facilitate democratic,
data-centric debate.
