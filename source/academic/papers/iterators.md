Many programming problems can be easily solved if we express them as computations
with some non-standard aspect. This is a very important problem, because today we
are struggling to efficiently program multi-core processors and to write asynchronous
code. Unfortunately main-stream languages such as C# do not support any direct way
for encoding unrestricted non-standard computations. In languages like Haskell and F#,
this can be done using monads with syntactic extensions they provide and it has been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems.

In this paper, we present
a general way for encoding monadic computations in the C# 2.0 language with a convenient
syntax using a specific language feature called iterators. This gives us a way to use
well-known non-standard computations enabling easy asynchronous programming or for
example the use of software transactional memory in plain C#. Moreover, it also opens
monads in general to a wider audience which can help in the search for other useful and
previously unknown kinds of computations.

## Corrections
This paper contains a number of issues. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that
C# 2.0 iterators keep mutable state, which makes running a continuation multiple times
harder (as a result, it is only possible to easily encode one-shot continuations).

This limits the applicability of this approach. However, the paper is still interesting,
especially since many main-stream languages (including Python and JavaScript) are
attempting (as of 2013) to apply the approaches discussed in the paper.
