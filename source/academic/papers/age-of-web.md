Most programming languages were designed before the age of web.
This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional language designers take
for granted. For example, programs do not run in a closed word, but must instead interact with
(changing and likely unreliable) services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous
or event-driven, and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments.

In this paper, we present how F# language and libraries face the challenges posed by the web.
Technically, this comprises using _type providers_ for integration with external information
sources and for integration with untyped programming environments, using _lightweight
meta-programming_ for targeting JavaScript and _computation expressions_ for writing
asynchronous code.

In this inquiry, the holistic perspective is more important than each of the features in isolation.
We use a practical case study as a starting point and look how F# language and libraries approach
the challenges posed by the web. The specific lessons learned are perhaps less interesting than
our attempt to uncover hidden assumptions that no longer hold in the age of web.
