Research on programming systems design needs to consider a wide range of aspects in their full
complexity. This includes user interaction, implementation, interoperability but also the
sustainability of its ecosystem and wider societal impact. Established methods of evaluation, such
as formal proofs or user studies, impose a reductionist view that makes it difficult to see
programming systems in their full complexity and, consequently, force researchers to adopt simplistic
perspectives.

This paper asks whether we can create more amenable methods of evaluation derived from existing
informal practices such as multimedia essays, demos, and interactive tutorials. These popular
forms incorporate recorded or scaffolded interaction, often embedded in a text that guides the
reader. Can we augment such forms with structure and guidelines to obtain methods of evaluation
suitable for peer review? We do not answer this question, but merely seek to identify some of the
problems and instigate a community discussion. In that spirit we propose to hold a panel session
at the conference.
