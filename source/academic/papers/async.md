We describe the asynchronous programming model in F#, and its applications to reactive,
parallel and concurrent programming. The key feature combines a core language with a
non-blocking modality to author lightweight asynchronous tasks, where the modality has
control flow constructs that are syntactically a superset of the core language and are
given an asynchronous semantic interpretation.

This allows smooth transitions between synchronous and asynchronous code and eliminates
callback-style treatments of inversion of control, without disturbing the foundation of
CPU-intensive programming that allows F# to interoperate smoothly and compile efficiently.
An adapted version of this approach has recently been announced for a future version of C#.
