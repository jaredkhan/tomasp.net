_What is the definition of 'type'_? Having a clear and precise answer to this
question would avoid many misunderstandings and prevent meaningless discussions
that arise from them. But having such clear and precise answer to this question
would also hurt science, _"hamper the growth of knowledge"_ and _"deflect the
course of investigation into narrow channels of things already understood"_.

In this essay, I argue that not everything we work with needs to be precisely
defined. There are many definitions used by different communities, but none
of them applies universally. A brief excursion into philosophy of science shows
that this is not just tolerable, but necessary for progress. Philosophy also
suggests how we can think about this imprecise notion of type.

As far as I know, the Onward! Essays talk has not been recorded, but I did a more recent talk
about the topic of the paper at Lambda Days 2016 conference organized by
<a href="https://vimeo.com/erlang">Erlang Solutions</a>. You can watch my
<a href="https://vimeo.com/160733435">History and Philosophy of types</a> talk below, or on Vimeo.
