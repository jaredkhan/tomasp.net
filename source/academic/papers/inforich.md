The F# language includes a feature called _F# 3.0 Type Providers_ to support the integration 
of internet-scale information sources into a strongly typed functional-first programming 
environment. 
In this position paper we describe the key themes in information-rich functional programming 
that we have observed during this work. Our contribution is to document these themes and 
highlight future challenges and opportunities, in the context of a recently released, 
practical, open-source system for information-rich functional programming. We believe that 
this area is rich in excellent opportunities for future language and tooling research, 
information-space integration and schematization techniques.
