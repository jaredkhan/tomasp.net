# The Gamma: Data Exploration through Iterative Prompting

 - description: This paper presents The Gamma, a data exploration environment for non-experts,
 	   based on a single interaction principle. The Gamma allows transfer of knowledge from one
		 data source to another and learning from previously created data analyses.
 	 	 Our approach allows journalists and the public to benefit from the rise
 	 	 of open data, by making data exploration easier, more transparent and more reproducible.

Governments, non-profit organizations and citizen initiatives publish increasing amounts of
data, but extracting insights from such data and presenting them to the public is hard.
First, data comes in a variety of formats that each requires a different tool. Second, many
data exploration tools do not reveal how a result was obtained, making it difficult to reproduce
the results and check how they were obtained.

We contribute The Gamma, a novel data exploration environment for non-experts. The Gamma is based
on a single interaction principle and using it results in transparent and reproducible scripts.
This allows transfer of knowledge from one data source to another and
learning from previously created data analyses. We evaluate the usability and learnability of
The Gamma through a user study on non-technical employees of a research institute.
We argue that the our approach allows journalists and the public to benefit from the rise
of open data, by making data exploration easier, more transparent and more reproducible.
