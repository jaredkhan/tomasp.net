Our thinking is shaped by basic assumptions that we rarely question. Such assumptions exist at 
multiple levels. Foucault’s episteme grounds knowledge within a particular epoch; Kuhn’s 
research paradigms determine how scientists of a given discipline approach problems and Lakatos’ 
research programmes provide undisputable assumptions followed by a group of scientists.

In this paper, we attempt to uncover some of these hidden assumptions in the area of programming 
language research. What are some of the hidden assumptions that we never question and that 
determine how programming languages are designed? And what might the world look like if we based 
our thinking or scientific method on different basic principles?
