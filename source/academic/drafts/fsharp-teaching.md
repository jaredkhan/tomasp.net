Functional programming is often taught at universities to first-year or second-year 
students and most of the teaching materials have been written for this audience. With 
the recent rise of functional programming in the industry, it becomes important to 
teach functional concepts to professional developers with deep knowledge of other 
paradigms, most importantly object-oriented.

We present our experience with teaching functional programming and F# to experienced 
.NET developers through a book Real-World Functional Programming and commercially offered 
F# trainings. The most important novelty in our approach is the use of C# for relating 
functional F# with object-oriented C# and for introducing some of the functional concepts.

By presenting principles such as immutability, higher-order functions and functional 
types from a different perspective, we are able to build on existing knowledge of 
professional developers. This contrasts with a common approach that asks students to 
forget everything they know about programming and think completely differently. We 
believe that our observations are relevant for trainÂ¬ings designed for practitioners, 
but perhaps also for students who explore functional relatively late in the curriculum.
