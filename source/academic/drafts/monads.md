# Monads are not what they seem

 - description: Computer science provides an in-depth understanding of technical and mathematical 
    aspects of programming concepts, but if we want to understand how programming concepts evolve, 
    how programmers think about them and how they are used in practice, we need to consider a 
    broader perspective. In this paper, we develop such broader understanding of monads.
