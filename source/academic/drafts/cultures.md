Programming language research does not exist in isolation. Many programming languages are designed
to address a particular business problem or as a reflection of more wide-ranging shifts in the
computing community. Histories of individual programming languages often take their own contexts
for granted, which makes it difficult to connect the dots and understand the history of programming
in a holistic way.

This paper documents the broader socio-technological context that shapes programming languages.
To structure our discussion, we introduce the idea of a _culture of programming_ which embodies
a particular perspective on programming. We identify four major cultures: hacker culture,
engineering culture, managerial culture and mathematical culture.
To understand how the cultures interact and influence the design of programming languages, we look
at a number of historical strands in four lectures that comprise this paper. We follow the
mathematization of programming, the development of types, discussion on fundamental limits of
complex software systems and the methods that help make modern software acceptably reliable.

This paper makes two key observations. First, many interesting developments that shape programming
languages happen when multiple cultures meet and interact. Those include both the development of new
technical artifacts and controversies that change how we think about programming. Second, the cultures of
programming retain a strong identity throughout the history. In other words, the existence of
multiple cultures of programming is not a sign of an immaturity of the field, but instead, a sign
that programming developed a fruitful multi-cultural identity.

The methodology used in this paper is inspired by historically grounded philosophy of science.
We look at the four aforementioned historical strands and find a conceptual framework capable
of effectively explaining the key historical developments.
Using the prism of cultures of programming to look at the history of computing sheds a new light
at the controversies and the development of technical artifacts that we discuss in this paper.
It provides an explanation for a number of, otherwise hard to grasp, historical developments and
it explains why certain debates keep recurring over the history. For a programming language
researcher, the paper might also point at new, yet unexplored, intersections between cultures.
