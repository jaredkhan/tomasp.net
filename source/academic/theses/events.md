# Reactive Programming with Events (Master thesis)

 - subtitle: Master thesis. Charles University in Prague, 2010
 - description: The thesis uses early version of joinad language extension for F# and garbage collection
     for events. Based on these concepts, it builds a simple reactive library for F# that allows
     writing reactive computations in both control-flow and data-flow styles.

The reactive programming model is largely different to what we're used to as we 
don't have a full control over the application's control flow. As a result, reactive 
applications need to be structured differently and need to be written using different 
patterns. We build an easier way for developing reactive applications. Our work 
integrates declarative and imperative approach to reactive programming and uses the 
notion of event as the unifying concept. We discuss the problem of memory management 
in this scenario and develop a technique for collecting not only events that are not 
reachable, but also events that cannot trigger any action. Next, we present a language 
extension that makes it possible to wait for occurrences of events that match some 
defined pattern. The extension isn't bound to the reactive programming model and can 
be used for concurrent and parallel programming scenarios as well. Finally, we develop 
a reactive programming library that builds on top of the ideas discussed earlier and 
we present semantics of the library to enable formal reasoning about reactive programs.
