  draw snowflakes using fractals. Source code contains object for drawing one snowflake
  and Windows forms control for falling snow. This control is used for creating
  screensaver applications. In the screensaver applications, snowflakes are created
  using random settings, so there are almost unlimited variations of snowflakes.</p><h3>Fractals</h3><p>Fractals are geometrical shapes, where a certain pattern repeats itself depending
  on zoom. That means, when you zoom in a part of the object, it looks the same way or
  is very similar like the original object before the zoom.</p><p>In programs, fractals are created using recursion. Same (or very similar) drawing
  operation is repeated until depth of recursion exceeds specified number. In my
  application, the drawing operation is performed on the line connecting the center of
  the snowflake with its edge and then on new lines created in first step.</p><h2>Snowflakes</h2><p>Application uses two slightly different algorithms to make more various
  snowflakes. These two methods have same input parameters with same meaning, so it is
  very simple to use both methods for drawing snowflakes.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how snowflakes are generated and what each input
  parameter does, install screensaver and go to <i>Settings</i> - <i>Snowflake
  Preview</i>.</p><h3>First type (LineType)</h3><p><img height="79" alt="First type of snow flakes" src="fractalsnow/linetype.gif" width="277" /></p><h4>Drawing snowflake</h4><ol><li>Six fractal branches are drawn from the center of the snowflake to the

</pre><h3>Using this code</h3><h4>Using SnowFlake</h4><p><code>SnowFlake</code> object can be used to draw snowflakes. It has two methods
  for drawing. First method <code>Draw(Graphics, PointF)</code> can be used for normal
  drawing and second method <code>Draw(Graphics, PointF, int)</code> allows you to
  specify alpha value for drawn pixels. Second method is used in screensavers for
  snowflake melting. <code>RandomSnowFlake</code> is class derived from
  <code>SnowFlake</code>. Only one difference is that, all properties of snowflake are
  generated from random numbers in constructor, so you don't have to set all properties
  if you want to create snowflake.</p><pre lang="cs"><span class="c">// Draw snowflakes in Paint event handler</span>
private void Form_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs pe)
{
  Random rndGen=new Random();
  pe.Graphics.Clear(Color.Black);
  SnowFlake flake=new SnowFlake(),
    random=new RandomSnowFlake(rndGen.Next(Int32.MaxValue));
          
  <span class="c">// draw snowflake</span>
  flake.Draw(pe.Graphics,new PointF(70.0f,70.0f));

  <span class="c">// draw melting snowflake</span>
  flake.Draw(pe.Graphics,new PointF(70.0f,140.0f,128));

  <span class="c">// draw random snowflake</span>
  random.Draw(pe.Graphics,new PointF(105.0f,105.0f));
}
</pre><h4>Using SnowControl</h4><p><code>SnowControl</code> is the control for creating falling snowflakes. This is
  exactly the same control as control filling the whole screen of screensaver. This
  control can be added to a <code>Form</code> using designer, or manually using code
  similar to following:</p><p>This control has a lot of properties, that are described in <i>Screen saver
  settings</i> section.</p><pre lang="cs">
SnowControl snowCtrl;

public Form()
{
  <span class="c">// Create control</span>
  snowCtrl=new SnowControl();
  Controls.Add(snowCtrl);
  snowCtrl.Dock=DockStyle.Fill;
}

private void Form_Load(object sender,EventArgs e)
{
  <span class="c">// Start animation</span>
  snowCtrl.Start();
}
</pre><p><img height="112" alt="Screen saver" src="fractalsnow/screensaver.gif" width="125" align="right" /></p><h2>SnowControl and Screensaver settings</h2><h4>Environment</h4><p>Property called <code>StopFalling</code> is length in pixels from bottom of the
  screen, where falling snowflakes will stop falling. If this property is less than
  zero, snowflakes will fall outside the screen. Falling snowflakes are affected by
  wind. The <code>WindForce</code> specifies how the snowflakes will be inflected by
  wind and <code>WindChanging</code> determinates how fast will the direction of wind
  change.</p><h4>Snowflakes</h4><p>You can change number of snowflakes displayed on screen (<code>MaxFlakes</code>)
  and color of snowflakes (<code>FlakeColor</code>). Size and speed properties are
  randomly generated between specified maximal and minimal values
  (<code>MinSpeed</code>, <code>MaxSpeed</code> and <code>MinSize</code>,
  <code>MaxSize</code>).</p><p>When snowflake falls to the bottom of the screen, it stays at this location for a
  specified number of frames (<code>MeltingStart</code>), after this time the snowflake
  starts melting and it melts for a number of frames specified by
  <code>MeltingFluency</code> property.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>Background of screensaver can be any image compatible with .NET, solid color or
  gradient from two colors (top and bottom color). Note that if you set background to
  image and you have more snowflakes, then the screensaver can be very slow!</p><h2>Thanks to...</h2><p>Thanks to Adam Abonyi for this idea, useful remarks and big help during the composition of this
