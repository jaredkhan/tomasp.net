Hello New York. Learn some F#!

 - description: As some people in the F# community may already know, I'm visiting New York  for three months and I'm working (doing an internship) with Howard Mansell at  Blue Mountain Capital. We're working on some interesting F# tools for data science, but it also means that I can be more involved in the great New York F# community!

Exactly two weeks ago, I started a three month internship at BlueMountain Capital in New York.
They have a [technical blog](http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/) and should be well known to the
F# community thanks to the [R type provider](https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider)
which was written by Howard Mansell ([@hmansell](https://twitter.com/hmansell)).
I'll have the pleasure of working with Howard on some more open source data-science related tools for F#
(and C#). I'll write more about these when we have something to share, but if you want to
contribute and help us, join the Data and Machine Learning [working group at F# Foundation](http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/).

Aside from my work, I'm also happy to get involved with the great F# community in New York!
We already have some events planned - **Progressive F# Tutorials** and **FastTrack to F#** are
scheduled for September 16.-19. so you can become an F# guru in 4 days :-). But I'm also happy
to have a chat with anyone interested in F# and perhaps do a lunch time talk, if you need to
convince your colleagues or boss that F# is a good choice.

Become an F# master!
--------------------

Nobody can seriously promise you that you'll become an F# master in 4 days, but you can get pretty 
familiar with F# and confident enough to start working on your own F# projects. So, if you want to 
learn F#, you have a unique chance this September:

 * We are running [FastTrack to F#](http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp/ps-6679)
   on **16.-17. September** which is our two day training that explains F# basics followed by 
   the most important F# application areas - domain specific languages, data processing and
   concurrent programming.

 * Right after that, [Progressive F# Tutorials](http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials-nyc)
   are two days event with a keynotes by **Don Syme** and 
   **Miguel de Icaza** and two tracks full of both beginner and advanced F# sessions.

**SPECIAL OFFER:** If you come to the training, you should be ready to go to all the advanced
sessions, so combining both of the events is a perfect idea :-). Moreover, if you buy a ticket
to the trainings, we'll give you a free ticket to the tutorials! If you're interested, 
email me at [tomas@tomasp.net](mailto:tomas@tomasp.net).

Fancy a lunch?
--------------

I'm obviously happy to meet any F#ers in New York for a lunch or an evening pint! Back in London, myself 
or [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/) visited a few companies to do a lunch time F# talk. 

If you are interested in F#, this is a good way to present F# to your colleagues and to your boss
(especially, if they are already bored with you talking about F# all the time ;-)). As one of the 
founding members of the [F# Foundation](http://fsharp.org), I can help explaining why F# matters,
how it helps you save time & money and get things done faster. I also have various material from
previous talks, including topics relevant to option pricing, data analysis, concurrency etc.

So, if you want to meet and have a chat, get in touch on Twitter ([@tomaspetricek](https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek))
or email me. BlueMountain has offices on [280 Park Avenue](http://goo.gl/maps/ZtUvP), so let me
know if you work nearby!
