<p>The end of the summer holiday season is getting closer. Luckily, I was in Prague last
week so I actually noticed there was summer this year!</p>

<p>After a few quiet months, the autumn is going to be quite busy.
  Microsoft's <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//build/</a>
  conference will reveal the future of software development for Windows,
  but great things are going on in the F# world too. Don Syme is going to talk about 
  <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/fsharp3">F# Information Rich Programming</a>
  at Progressive F# Tutorials in November, which should reveal more about F# 3.0 and type providers!</p>

<p>I have quite a few speaking engagements planned already, so
  if you want to learn about functional programming in .NET (and become a better
  C# programmer) or about F# and asynchronous programming,
  here are a few events that you may be interested in...</p>

<h2>Functional .NET and F# Courses</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/autumn-2011-talks/sm.gif" class="rdecor" />
<p>First of all, I'm happy to announce that I'll be doing two courses for SkillsMatter
  together with <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a>. The
  <strong>Functional Programming in .NET</strong> course is designed for developers
  with some object-oriented (mainly C#) background who want to understand how to use
  functional ideas in practice and learn some F# on the side.</p>
<p>The <strong>Real-World F# Programming</strong> course is designed for people with
  some basic F# experience. It focuses on the most important areas where F# is being
  used today, including data processing, asynchronous and concurrent programming and
  the development of algorithms. Both courses are practical with a large number of 
  practical exercises.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For more information, visit <a href="http://functional-programming.net/courses/">F# trainings
    for .NET developers</a> on my Functional Programming web site.</li>
  <li>Booking for <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/functional-programming-in-dot-net/dh-2239">Functional Programming in .NET</a>
    (27-28 October, London)</li>
  <li>Booking for <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/real-world-f-programming/dh-2239">Real-World F# Programming</a>
    (15-16 December, London)</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from the two-day courses, I'll be also involved in other .NET or F# events in 
  London as well as elsewhere...</p>

<h3>Progressive F# Tutorials</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is a two-day event with two tracks of F# tutorials and a keynote on 
<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/fsharp3">Information Rich Programming 
in F# 3.0</a> by Don Syme.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I'll be doing one tutorial on asynchronous prog&#173;ramming and agents, but
  if there is a version of F# 3.0 available by November, we may even play with type providers!</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to attend, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials">book online now</a>!</li>
  <li>Tutorials take place on <strong>3-4 November</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>F#unctional Londoners</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Finally, I'll be also doing a talk at the F#unctional Londoners meeting in October. The 
  details are not yet finalized, so I'd love to hear from you - what topics are you interested
  in? Perhaps <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">asynchronous programming in C# and F#</a>
  and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-sequences.aspx">asynchronous sequences</a>?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The talk will probably be on <strong>5 October</strong>.</li>
  <li>Join <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/">F#unctional Londoners</a> to get all the updates!</li>

<h3>DDD Belfast</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">
I submitted two talk proposals to the Developer&#173;Developer&#173;Developer
conference in Belfast and one of them was accepted! The talk title is <strong>Asynchronous programming with F# and C#</strong> and it covers F# asynchronous workflows and the support for asynchronous programming in a future version of C#.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The event takes place at Belfast campus of the University of Ulster on Saturday, <strong>1 October</strong>.</li>
  <li>See the <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11">conference web site</a> for more information!</li>
</ul>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/autumn-2011-talks/fpd.png" class="rdecor" style="margin-left:0px"/><h3>FP Day Cambridge</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">
The event is full-day functional programming event with keynotes by Don Syme and Simon Peyton Jones,
case study talks and 3 hour tutorials. I'll be doing an F# tutorial with <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a>
and it should be a great way to get started with F#!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FP Day 2011 takes place at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge on Friday, <strong>14 October</strong>.</li>
  <li>You can save by <a href="http://www.fpday.net/fpday2011/">booking a ticket right now</a>.</li>
