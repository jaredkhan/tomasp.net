<p>Almost a week ago, I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fun-londoners-reactive.aspx">posted an invitation</a> to my 
  F# talk at the F#unctional Londoners user group. The theme of my talk was <em>reactive programming</em>, which 
  was also a topic of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/reactive-thesis.aspx">Master's thesis</a> (defended
  earlier in June), so I really enjoyed talking about it. In the talk, I discussed the two approaches that you can 
  use for developing reactive applications in F# (using examples in Silverlight):

<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative</strong> (or <em>data-flow</em> oriented) allows you to describe "what" should be 
    done with data that your component receives from various events (such as mouse position etc.) This can 
    be written using F# event combinators such as <code>Event.map</code> and <code>Event.scan</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative</strong> (or <em>control-flow</em> oriented) - in this style, we describe various
    states of the component (e.g. semaphore with green, orange and red) and describe transitions between the
    states. This can be written using F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and the <code>AwaitObservable</code>
    primitive (which you can get as part of the source code).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the folks from <a href="http://skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a> who provided place for the meetup
  and helped with the organization, the talk was also recorded and is already available online! Below, you can also 
  get all the nice Silverlight demos that I used during the talk...</p>

<p>Thanks again to Carolyn Miller and <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/" type="external">Phil Trelford</a>
  for organizing the talk and also to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme">Don Syme</a> for taking me to the
  airport in the early morning (at 4 AM...) after the talk.</p>
