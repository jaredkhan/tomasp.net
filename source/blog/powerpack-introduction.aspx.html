<p>This article is the first article of a series where I'll explain some of the
  F# features that are useful for numeric computing as well as some functionality from 
  the F# PowerPack library. Most of the content was originally written for 
  the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx">Numerical Computing in F#</a> chapter on MSDN (that I 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">announced earlier</a>), 
  but then we decided to focus on using F# with third party libraries that provide more
  efficient implementation and richer set of standard numeric functionality that's 
  needed when implementing machine learning and probabilistic algorithms or performing 
  statistical analysis. If you're interested in these topics, then the last section 
  (below) gives links to the important MSDN articles.</p>

<p>However, F# PowerPack still contains some useful functionality. It includes two
  additional numeric types and an implementation of matrix that integrates nicely
  with F#. The series also demonstrates how to use features of the F# language 
  (and core libraries) to write numeric code elegantly. In particular, we'll use the
  following aspects:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Overloaded operators.</strong> Any type can provide overloaded version of standard numeric 
    operators such as +, -, * and / as well as other non-standard operators (such as .*). 
    As a result, libraries can implement their own numeric types which are 
    indistinguishable from built-in types such as int.</li>

  <li><strong>Numeric literals.</strong> F# math libraries can enable using new numeric literals in the code. For example, you can 
    write a <code>BigRational</code> value representing one third as <code>1N/3N</code>. The <code>N</code> suffix used in the 
    notation is not hardcoded in the F# language and we'll see how to define similar 
    numeric type.</li>

  <li><strong>Static constraints.</strong> F# supports static member constraints, which can be used for writing functions that 
    work with any numeric type. For example, the <code>List.sum</code> function uses this feature. It 
    can sum elements of any list containing numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just a few of the F# language features that are useful when writing numeric code, but
there are many others. The usual F# development style using interactive tools, type safety that
prevents common errors, units of measure as well the expressivity of F# make it a great tool for
writing numeric code. For more information, take a look at the MSDN overview article

<h2>Numerical computing and F# PowerPack</h2>

<p>If you're looking for information about other PowerPack components,
  then Daniel Mohl (<a href="http://twitter.com/dmohl">@@dmohl</a>) wrote a series that covers
  numerical types and modules (<a href="http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/2011/08/getting-started-with-f-powerpack.html">Part 1</a>),
  asynchronous extensions (<a href="http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/2011/08/getting-started-with-f-powerpack-part-2.html">Part 2</a>),
  additional collection types (<a href="http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/2011/08/getting-started-with-f-powerpack-part-3.html">Part 3</a>),
  as well as lexing, parsing and SI units (<a href="http://bloggemdano.blogspot.com/2011/09/getting-started-with-f-powerpack-part-4.html">Part 4</a>).</p>

<p>In this article series, we look at most of the numerical computing features provided by 
  the F# PowerPack library. The following list shows the upcoming articles of the series:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx">F# Math (I.) - Numeric types in PowerPack</a></h3>
    <p>The PowerPack library provides two additional numeric types. The type 
    <code>BigRational</code> type represents arbitrary precision rational numbers and 
    <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers. This article briefly demonstrates
    both of the types. The version for .NET 2.0 also provides arbitrary size integers 
    (which are available for .NET 4 in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly).</p> </li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-matrix.aspx">F# Math (II.) - Using matrices for graph algorithms</a></h3>
    <p>The <code>matrix</code> type can be used for working with matrices that store 
    floating point numbers. It supports many of the common operations such as matrix 
    multiplication, point-wise addition and others. There is also a generic variant of 
    the type named <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>, which can be used for working with matrices 
    that contain values of type int or decimal.
    This article demonstrates how to use the <code>matrix</code> type to represent
    a graph using an <em>adjacency matrix</em> and how to calculate reachability in 
    the graph.</p></li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">F# Math (III.) - Defining custom numeric types</a></h3>
    <p>This step-by-step tutorial shows how to define a numeric type that can be written
      using a custom numeric literal and can be used with standard operators. The tutorial
      also uses <code>GlobalAssociations</code> module from F# PowerPack to allow using 
      the custom type as an element of F# <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code> type.</p></li>

  <li><h3>F# Math (IV.) - Writing generic code &#160;<span style="font-size:80%; font-weight:normal;">(Not available yet)</span></h3>
    <p>The article discusses two options for writing generic code that works with an
    any numeric type (such as <code>float</code> and <code>complex</code>). The first approach
    is based on F# <em>static member constraints</em> and the second is based on the 
    <code>GlobalAssociations</code> module from F# PowerPack. In this article, we compare
    both options and discuss which approach is preferable in what cases.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Numerical Computing in F# (MSDN)</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, F# PowerPack provides only basic implementation of matrices, which
  is not suitable for tasks that require efficient matrix multiplication. The library also
  does not implement any advanced operations such matrix decomposition or any support for 
  working with probability distributions or statistical analysis.</p>

<p>If you're interested in writing highly-efficient numeric code in F#, then it is recommended
  to use a third-party library (such as open-source <a href="http://mathnetnumerics.codeplex.com/">Math.NET Numerics</a>) that
  provide more efficient implementation and wider range of features. The MSDN section 
  <a href="TBD">Introduction to Numerical Computing in F#</a> provides more information
  including a review of existing libraries. It also includes examples that demonstrate the 
  following three options:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304363.aspx">Tutorial: Using Math.NET Numerics in F#</a></h3>
    <p>Math.NET Numerics aims to be the standard open source math library for .NET Framework. It is 
    released under the MIT license and so it can be used in both commercial and non-commercial projects, 
    as well as modified and redistributed. This tutorial gives an introduction on how to use the 
    various components of this library. </p></li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304371.aspx">Tutorial: Using Microsoft Sho in F#</a></h3>
    <p>Microsoft Sho is a numerical computing platform with support for linear algebra, optimization, 
    and visualization. This article gives an introduction to Sho and shows how to call its .NET 
    libraries from F#.</p></li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh304365.aspx">Tutorial: Using the F# PowerPack and the F# MathProvider</a></h3>
    <p>The F# PowerPack provides types for vectors and matrices, and the F# MathProvider supports 
    linear algebra operations on these types. This article presents an introduction to the two libraries.</p></li>
