<p>This week we finished new release of Phalanger (the PHP compiler for .NET platform). The goal in 
    this release was to fix many minor bugs preventing us from running some of the famous and 
    most often deployed open-source PHP applications, so with the new release you'll be able to 
    run for example <strong>MediaWiki</strong>, the wiki application that evolved from system used 
    on Wikipedia or probably the best-known PHP blogging and publishing system <strong>WordPress</strong>.
    Other applications that we tested can be found at Phalanger website in <a href="http://php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=apps">the
    list of tested PHP applications</a> [<a href="http://php-compiler.net/doku.php?id=apps" target="_blank">^</a>].
    Compatibility is very important for us, so if you have troubles running any open-source PHP application,
    let us know and we'll include it in our list!</p>

<p>Another thing that we focused on is interoperability between PHP scripts compiled using Phalanger 
    and other .NET languages. Using .NET objects from Phalanger is very intuitive and has almost no 
    limitations, however the other way is a bit difficult because of the dynamic nature of PHP language.
    If your PHP application can be compiled in the Phalanger <strong>pure</strong> mode, than the
    PHP objects can be exported and made available to C# and other languages. The methods of objects 
    exported using this method take <code>object</code> (the base class for every .NET object) as 
    a parameter, because PHP checks types at runtime, so this may be a bit confusing for the users.
    In the Beta 4 we tried to target these two issues - first, the fact that you have to use pure mode
    and second, the fact that exported objects can't contain any information about accepted types.
    This is a topic for entire article, so I'll write about it soon... Stay tuned :-)!</p>
