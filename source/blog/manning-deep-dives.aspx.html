<p>
  The F# language has been around for longer than many people suspect. My <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">first, completely outdated,
  blog post</a> was from May 2006. The Microsoft Research releases, sometime around 2006 were the
  first stable versions that gained some interest and slowly attracted commercial users.
</p>

<p>A lot has changed since the early days. F# now includes powerful features like <em>computation expressions</em>
  and <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and F# 3.0 comes with unique <em>type provider</em> mechanism.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of users from diverse domains: F# is used to model complex domains
  in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/TobiasGedell_EdenAnFWPFFrameworkForBuildingGUITools.pdf">finance</a> and science; asynchronous and concurrent features are used to write server-side components
  of <a href="http://theburningmonk.com/">social games</a> and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trelford-functional">trading systems</a>,
  but also in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/AdamGranicz_DevelopingAndIntegratingWebSharperApplicationsWithFacebook.pdf">web programming</a>;
  the expressivity of F# is used by machine learning experts to
  handle dirty data or <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=293">classify XBox players</a>. Moreover, the <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a>
  has been recently founded to support the collaboration between different commercial users, open-source 
  community and academia.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing interest in F#, but many of those who approach it ask (excellent) questions such as:
  <em>"In what problem domains can I benefit from F#?"</em> or <em>"How do I use F# in finance/science/gaming or web programming?"</em>
  and most importantly <em>"How do I approach different problems in F#?"</em>

<h2>Upcoming book: F# Deep Dives</h2>
<p>There is an increasing interest in F#, but many of those who approach it ask (excellent) questions such as:
  <em>"In what problem domains can I benefit from F#?"</em> or <em>"How do I use F# in finance/science/gaming or web programming?"</em>
  and most importantly <em>"How do I approach different problems in F#?"</em>
</p>

<p>I think the best answer to all of these questions is to look at the existing commercial uses of F#.
  And that's why I paired up with <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a> and <a href="http://manning.com">
  Manning</a> to edit a book containing chapters from a number of real-world users of F#. Both me and Phil
  are writing one or two chapters too, but the rest of the book will be written by recognized F# experts who
  use it in their daily work to solve real-world problems.

  <strong style="font-variant:small-caps">Deal of the Day!</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;
  The first two chapters of the book are already available <a href="http://manning.com/petricek2">from the Manning
  Early Access Program</a>. To get a 50% discount on December 18, 2012 for the MEAP eBook version of 
  <strong>F# Deep Dives</strong>, use the code <code>dotd1218</code> when you check out.

<h2>F# Deep Dives: Table of Content</h2>
<p>The book consists of 5 parts that cover the most common real-world uses of F#: 
  <em>Developing of Analytical Components</em>, <em>Processing and Analyzing Data</em>,
  <em>Creating End-user Applications</em> and <em>F# in the Larger Context</em>.
  The preliminary chapter list looks like this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Succeeding with functional-first languages in Industry</li>
<li>Implementing business rule engine</li>
<li>Parsing text based languages</li>
<li>Numerical computing in financial domain</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, there is an increasing number of commercial F# applications.
  If you want to learn about the domains where F# can make you more productive and help you to 
  write correct code, or if you want to learn how F# experts approach different problems, then
  the upcoming <strong>F# Deep Dives</strong> book is the book for you!
