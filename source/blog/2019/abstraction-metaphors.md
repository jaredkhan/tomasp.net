- the point of formal calculi is not to prove things, but to be a useful metaphor
- when we work with abstract things, we need a way of thinking about these
- concrete things mean concrete things, but what do abstract things mean? nothing?
- we need some concrete ideas for abstract things - design patterns, category theory
- neither is better or worse than other; they're all metaphors with misfits
- you are choosing what you expect readers of your code to know
