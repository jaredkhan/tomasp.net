  talks about alternative (and future) technologies.
</p>

<p>I'll be speaking at both Progressive F# Tutorials and TechMesh and I'm also doing a tutorial
  at TechMesh, so if you want to learn about F#, type providers in F# 3.0 and financial computing
  with F#, here are some talks that you should not miss...

<h2>Progressive F# Tutorials (November 1.-2.)</h2>

<img src="http://skillsmatter.com/custom/images/progfsharp150x170.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>The event consists of almost 10 talks and tutorials in two parallel tracks, aimed at beginners
  as well as experts. The keynote by Don Syme will introduce F# type providers, Robert Pickering
  will introduce F# through music and you'll also learn about web programming and cloud programming
  in F#!</p>
<p>I'll be participating in the "Programming with the stars" session where you'll learn how 
  F# programmers think about problem solving and I'm doing a tutorial with Simon Cousins on 
  "Concurrent time-series data processing" - a very hands-on and real-world session explaining
  agents, pipelines and other useful patterns.</p>

  also doing a tutorial on <strong>Financial computing with F#</strong>. You'll learn how to access
  and analyze historical stock prices, how to implement financial models and how to price
  options using the Black-Scholes formula.</p></li>
