<h1>Building LINQ Queries at Runtime in C#</h1>
<p>Since the first beta versions of LINQ we could hear comments that it is perfect for 
  queries known at compile-time, however it is not possible to use it for building queries 
  dynamically at runtime. In this article I show that this can be actually done very well for 
  most of the common cases. The solution offered by Microsoft (mentioned in [<a href="#dynqlinks">1</a>]) is to 
  build query from a string, however this has many limitations and it in fact goes completely

  compile-time checking. In this article I will first show a few support functions to make the life 
  a bit easier and then we will use them for building two sample applications that allows user to 
  build a query dynamically. The solution is largely motivated by my previous use of F#, where 
  working with “expressions” is possible at more advanced level, however I’ll write about F# later 
  and now let’s get back to C# 3.0.</p>
  
<h2>Linq Utilities #1: Expandable Queries</h2>
<p>First of all, we will need an extension that I wrote some time ago, which allows us to “call functions in LINQ queries” as 
  demonstrated in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// Lambda expression that calculates the price
Expression&lt;Func&lt;Nwind.Product, decimal?&gt;&gt; calcPrice = 
  (p) =&gt; p.UnitPrice * 1.19m;

// Query that selects products 
var q = 
  from p in db.Products.ToExpandable()  
  where calcPrice.Expand(p) &gt; 30.0m
  select new { 
    p.ProductName, 
    OriginalPrice = p.UnitPrice,
    ShopPrice = calcPrice.Expand(p) };
</pre>

<p>It works relatively simple – you can write a function you want to call in a query using anonymous 
  function declared as an Expression, than you’ll have to add a ToExpandable call to the data table and finally, 
  you can call your functions (which are actually expressions) using the Expand extension method (note that 
  in the earlier versions I used Invoke, but the name conflicts with some standard functions in the newest beta 
  versions). You can read more about this in my earlier blog post [<a href="#dynqlinks">2</a>], but in an essence, the ToQueryable creates a 
  thin layer that processed the entire LINQ query before it is sent to the “LINQ to SQL” translator and it replaces 
  all occurrences of the Expand call with the body of the function, so that the “LINQ to SQL” can understand the query.
  The latest version of these extensions is available at CodePlex [<a href="#dynqlinks">3</a>], but the DLL is also included in the 
  downloads at the end of this article.</p>
  
<h2>Linq Utilities #2: Type Inference for Anonymous Functions</h2>
<p>The second little utility will allow us to use C# implicitly typed variables (using the var keyword) to declare 
  anonymous functions and lambda expressions (i.e. data representation of the anonymous function). As you probably know you, 
  the decision whether anonymous function will be compiled as a Func delegate (that can be invoked) or as an Expression data 
  structure (that can be for example translated to SQL) depends on the variable type:</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
Func&lt;int,int,int&gt; func = (int a, int b) =&gt; a + b;
Expression&lt;Func&lt;int,int,int&gt;&gt; expr = (int a, int b) =&gt; a + b;
</pre>
<p>Obviously the following code looks very confusing:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">var func = (int a, int b) =&gt; a + b;</pre>
<p>The problem is that the compiler doesn’t know if func should be of type Expression or Func and indeed, if you 
  try it you will get a compiler error message saying “Cannot assign lambda expression to an implicitly-typed local variable”. 
  Unfortunately this forces you to write the type, which can be really complicated sometimes and also this way of declaring 
  anonymous functions makes it impossible to write an anonymous function returning C# 3.0 anonymous type:</p>
  
<pre lang="csharp">Func&lt;int,int,???&gt; func = (int a, int b) =&gt; new { Sum = a + b, Mul = a * b };</pre>
<p>When you want to return anonymous type you can no longer write name of the type (because it is anonymous!), so 
  writing expression like this looks like an impossible task. Luckily we can implement really simple workaround for this problem:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
public static class Linq {
  // Returns the given anonymous method as a lambda expression
  public static Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, R&gt;&gt; 
      Expr&lt;T, R&gt;(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, R&gt;&gt; f) {
    return f;
  }

  // Returns the given anonymous function as a Func delegate
  public static Func&lt;T, R&gt; 
      Func&lt;T, R&gt;(Func&lt;T, R&gt; f) {
    return f;
  }
}</pre>
<p>You can see that we declared two simple static methods that just return the argument, however the type of the 
  argument (which is a Func delegate in case of the Func method and Expression data type in case of the Expr method) 
  tells the compiler if we want to build an expression or a delegate. Using this class we can rewrite the previous examples as following:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// Let’s start with the simple examples:
var func = Linq.Func((int a, int b) =&gt; a + b);
var expr = Linq.Expr((int a, int b) =&gt; a + b);

// .. and using anonymous types is possible as well!
var func = Linq.Func((int a, int b) =&gt; 
  new { Sum = a + b, Mul = a * b });
var expr = Linq.Expr ((int a, int b) =&gt; 
  new { Sum = a + b, Mul = a * b });
</pre>
<p>Note that when using Linq.Func or Linq.Expr you have to explicitly specify the type of the arguments, because the 
  compiler can’t infer this from the type of the variable, however the code is usually shorter anyway and in addition you can use anonymous types!</p>

<h2>Dynamic Queries #1: Selecting Customers</h2>
<p>All right, let’s finally look how we can build a LINQ query dynamically at runtime! In the first example we will implement 
  one feature that may be quite common in a lot of applications. We will build a query for selecting customers from the 
  Northwind database and we will let user to choose what property of the <code>Customer</code> type he wants to enter. For simplicity 
  we will give a choice between <code>CompanyName</code>, <code>Country</code> and a <code>ContactName</code>. Once the user selects what property he wants to 
  query, we will ask for the value and run a query that will return all customers whose property selected by the user 
  contains the entered value (as a substring). To implement this we first create a data context and then we write a function 
  that will build a LINQ query once it gets a value entered by the user and a lambda expression representing a function 
  that reads the selected property from of the customer. It may sound a bit confusing, but I’ll explain everything soon:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext();

var queryBuilder = Linq.Func
  ((Expression&lt;Func&lt;Customer, string&gt;&gt; selector, string val) =&gt;
      from c in db.Customers.ToExpandable()
      where selector.Expand(c).IndexOf(val) != -1
      select c);
</pre>
<p>Before digging deeper, let’s look how the queryBuilder function can be used:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var q = queryBuilder(c =&gt; c.CompanyName, "ab");
foreach (var cust in q)
  Console.WriteLine(cust);
</pre>
<p>So what exactly happens here? We built a function (or maybe parameterized query would be better name) called <code>queryBuilder</code> 
  that has two arguments. The second argument is a value that the user entered and the first argument is a lambda expression 
  (named <code>selector</code>) that specifies what property of the <code>Customer</code> type we want to look for – when we give it an anonymous method 
  that returns company name of a customer as an argument it will build a query that returns all customers with the specified company name.</p>
  
<p>When you run the code, it executes the <code>queryBuilder</code> function with the lambda expression reading company name and a value 
  “ab”. The <code>queryBuilder</code> then returns a query that calls the lambda expression using the <code>Expand</code> method which I talked about 
  earlier (in <strong>Linq Utilities #1</strong>). It is also important to note that the query uses the <code>ToExpandable</code> method, because this has to 
  be present anywhere where we want to use <code>Expand</code> to call some lambda expression in a LINQ query.</p>
  
<p>Let’s now finish the sample and write a code that actually allows user to choose how he wants to query the <code>Customers</code> data table:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, Expression&lt;Func&lt;Customer, string&gt;&gt;&gt; 
  { { "CompanyName", c =&gt; c.CompanyName },
    { "Country",     c =&gt; c.Country },
    { "ContactName", c =&gt; c.ContactName } };

// Get the input from the user
Console.Write("Filter - field name (CompanyName, ContactName, Country):\n&gt; ");
string field = Console.ReadLine();

Console.Write("Filter - value:\n&gt; ");
string value = Console.ReadLine();

// Build the query using query builder and run it
var q = queryBuilder(dict[field], value);
foreach (var cust in q)
  Console.WriteLine(cust);
</pre>
<p>The application (just a simple console program) creates a dictionary that contains string as a key and a lambda 
  expression for reading specific properties of a customer as a value. When user enters a string representing the 
  property, it looks it up in the dictionary and gets a lambda expression that can be given as an argument to our 
  parameterized query declared earlier. And that’s all! You could very easily use the same principle in a Windows 
  Forms applications and let user select the property for example from a drop down list, which is probably the most 
  common scenario for building LINQ queries at runtime.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Queries #2: Combining Functions Using “OR” and “AND”</h2>
<p>In this example, we will write slightly more complex application that builds LINQ query dynamically.
  It will allow user to choose if he wants to combine several criteria using <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>
  logical operator and then enter the values to find for every property (again, we use <code>Customer</code> 
  table from a Northwind database). This means that the user we will be able to enter queries like <code>(CompanyName = "Google") OR 
  (Country = "Czech Republic")</code> or <code>(CompanyName = "Microsoft") AND (Country = "USA")</code>. The key aspect in
  this example is that query is combined from several basic conditions without knowing the number of these conditions in advance, 
  so this principle could be used when you want to allow the user to add any number of conditions he wants.
</p>
<p>We will again need a dictionary for mapping string (entered by the user) to a lambda expression returning
  the property of the <code>Customer</code> object. To make the code a bit more readable then in the previous example
  we will define an abbreviation for this rather complex type, which can be done thanks to the C# <code>using</code> construct
  (unfortunately there are a few limitations, so we have to use fully qualified namespace names):
  </p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using CustomerPropSelector = System.Linq.Expressions
  .Expression&lt;System.Func&lt;EeekSoft.LinqDemos.Customer, string&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Now we can use the <code>CustomerPropSelector</code> type as a value in a dictionary (it is actually the
  same dictionary as the one we used in the previous example):</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
NorthwindDataContext db = new NorthwindDataContext();
var dict = new Dictionary&lt;string, CustomerPropSelector&gt; 
   { { "CompanyName", c =&gt; c.CompanyName },
     { "Country",     c =&gt; c.Country },
     { "ContactName", c =&gt; c.ContactName } };
</pre>
<p>The next type abbreviation that we will use in the code will represent a condition telling whether
  specified customer matches the specified criteria or not. The condition is a lambda expression
  taking a <code>Customer</code> object as an argument and returning a boolean value:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using CustomerCondition = System.Linq.Expressions
  .Expression&lt;System.Func&lt;EeekSoft.LinqDemos.Customer, bool&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
<p>We can now define two primitive conditions that we will need later - to define a condition
  we use the C# anonymous function syntax, so you can easily write a condition that for example
  tests whether a customer is from UK or something like that. The two primitive conditions that we need
  are however really trivial - one of them returns <code>true</code> for every customer and the other <code>false</code>:  </p>
<pre lang="csharp">
CustomerCondition trueCond  = (c) =&gt; true;
CustomerCondition falseCond = (c) =&gt; false;
</pre>
<p>Now, we will need a way for combining two conditions, so we can write a <em>combinator</em> that can be used
  to produce a condition from two of them. We will use two such combinators later. One will be <code>OR</code> which 
  takes two conditions and returns <code>true</code> when any of them returns <code>true</code> and the other
  will be <code>AND</code> which will return <code>true</code> when both conditions return <code>true</code>, 
  as you would expect. The interesting is the type of these combinators - it is a function taking two conditions
  and returning a condition as a result, so we could write them as <code>Func&lt;CustomerCondition, CustomerCondition, CustomerCondition&gt;</code>.
  Unfortunately, the C# <code>using</code> statement doesn't allow using nested abbreviations, so we have to 
  replace <code>CustomerCondition</code> in the previous type and we'll get somewhat ugly type:
</p>

<pre lang="csharp">
using CustomerConditionCombinator = 
  System.Func&lt;System.Linq.Expressions.Expression&lt;System.Func&lt;EeekSoft.LinqDemos.Customer, bool&gt;&gt;, 
              System.Linq.Expressions.Expression&lt;System.Func&lt;EeekSoft.LinqDemos.Customer, bool&gt;&gt;, 
              System.Linq.Expressions.Expression&lt;System.Func&lt;EeekSoft.LinqDemos.Customer, bool&gt;&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Despite the fact that C# forces us to write this in a really ugly way, it isn't that difficult to understand what it actually does - 
  it just takes two conditions (which are actually lambda expressions returning a boolean value when given 
  <code>Customer</code> as an argument) and returns a condition that can call these two conditions and produces 
  boolean as a result, very likely by performing some logical operation on the values
  returned by these two conditions. We can now write two basic combinators for logical <code>OR</code> and <code>AND</code>.
  The combinator receives two conditions (<code>f</code> and <code>g</code>) as arguments, and returns a
  new lambda expression as the result. This lambda expression takes a <code>Customer</code> value as an argument,
  calls the two conditions using the <code>Expand</code> method and performs the logical operation on the result: </p>
<pre lang="csharp">
CustomerConditionCombinator combineOr = 
  (f, g) =&gt; (c) =&gt; f.Expand(c) || g.Expand(c);

CustomerConditionCombinator combineAnd = 
  (f, g) =&gt; (c) =&gt; f.Expand(c) &amp;&amp; g.Expand(c);
</pre>

<p>Now we have everything we need to finally start building the query! Let me first demonstrate how we can
  build a query using the <code>combineOr</code> combinator from two simple conditions, one testing whether
  the customer is from UK and the other testing if it's from Seattle:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// Define two simple conditions first
CustomerCondition isUk = (c) =&gt; c.Country == "UK";
CustomerCondition isSeattle = (c) =&gt; c.City == "Seattle"

// Combine the conditions using OR
CustomerCondition expr = combineOr(isUk, isSeattle);

// Build a query (using 'Expand' and 'ToExpandable')
var q = from c in db.Customers.ToExpandable()
        where expr.Expand(c) select c;
</pre>
<p>If you run this example, it will indeed return all customers that are either from UK or live in Seattle.
  Note that we still have to use the <code>Expand</code> to call the condition we built in the 
  LINQ query and it is also important not to forget the <code>ToExpandable</code> call, otherwise the “LINQ to SQL”
  will give an error message that it doesn't understand the query. </p>
<p>Let's now move to the final example - here we will actually let user construct a query he wants. Let's assume
  we have a value <code>generateOr</code> saying if we want to build a query by combinating several conditions using
  <code>OR</code> or using <code>AND</code>. To build a query we will start with one of our primitive conditions and
  add a condition using the combinator for every property of the customer. This means that when combining conditions
  using <code>OR</code> we will start with a query representing <code>"false"</code>, than we will append first condition
  and get something like <code>"(false || cond1)"</code>, after adding second condition we will get
  <code>"(false || cond1) || cond2"</code> and so on. You can see that when building a sequence of 
  <code>OR</code>s we need to start with <code>falseCond</code>, so that the condition returns <code>true</code> only
  when any of the conditions succeeds and when building sequence of <code>AND</code>s, we have to start with <code>trueCond</code>, 
  so that the condition succeeds when all conditions return <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The code to build a condition in the way described in the previous paragraph can be written as a <code>foreach</code> loop
  (working with the <code>KeyValuePair</code> from the dictionary declared above) that modifies the variable
  holding the current expression (<code>expr</code>) in every iteration:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
// Select the combinator and initial condition
CustomerConditionCombinator combinator = 
  generateOr ? combineOr : combineAnd;
CustomerCondition expr = 
  generateOr ? falseCond : trueCond;
  
// Loop over all properties in the dictionary  
foreach (var item in dict)
{
  // Read the value from the user
  Console.Write("Enter value for '{0}':\n&gt; ", item.Key);
  string enteredVal = Console.ReadLine();
  CustomerPropSelector propSelector = item.Value;
  
  // Build a condition testing whether entered value is a substring
  CustomerCondition currentCond = (c) =&gt; 
    propSelector.Expand(c).IndexOf(enteredVal) != -1;
    
  // Finally, combine expressions using the combinator
  expr = combinator(expr, currentCond);
}
</pre>
<p>Since C# 3.0 and LINQ in general use some of the concepts from functional programming, we can actually used
  one nice functional trick to write the code in a slightly shorter and less error-prone way. We can use
  a query operator called <code>Fold</code> (it was part of the LINQ in earlier version, but it seems to be missing
  now, so I added it to my LINQ Extensions [<a href="#dynqlinks">3</a>] project). What does this operation do?
  It takes some initial value and runs a specified function to combine the value with every element in the 
  sequence step by step. In our case the initial value is a condition (either <code>trueCond</code> or <code>falseCond</code>)
  and the function to combine values is essentially the body of the <code>foreach</code> loop. This means that
  function will ask user for the value and return the value newly produced by the combinator:</p>
  
<pre lang="csharp">
CustomerConditionCombinator combinator = 
  generateOr ? combineOr : combineAnd;

// Build expression using the 'Fold' aggregate operator
var expr = dict.Fold((e, item) =&gt; {
    // Read the value from the user
    Console.Write("Enter value for '{0}':\n&gt; ", item.Key);
    string enteredVal = Console.ReadLine();
    CustomerPropSelector propSelector = item.Value;    
    
    // Build a condition testing whether entered value is a substring
    CustomerCondition currentCond = (c) =&gt; 
      propSelector.Expand(c).IndexOf(enteredVal) != -1;
      
    // Finally, return the combined expression
    return combinator(e, currentCond); 
  }, generateOr ? falseCond : trueCond);
</pre>

<p>Finally, we can use a simple LINQ query to run the generated condition (<code>expr</code> variable) - as mentioned in 
  other places of this article, we can call it using <code>Expand</code> and we shouldn't forgot <code>ToExpandable</code>
  call which processes our combined expression before calling the “LINQ to SQL” translator:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var q = from c in db.Customers.ToExpandable()
        where expr.Expand(c) select c;
</pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this article convinced you that there is quite reasonable way for building queries dynamically at runtime in LINQ,
  which is much safer and less error-prone than building a string. Even though it may look complicated at the beginning after
  defining a few primitive constructs the code for building queries looks reasonable and is also extensible, so you're not limited
  to combining conditions sequentially using only two operators as I demonstrated in the example, in fact it could be easily
  modified to build for example a tree representing more complex logical combinations of conditions.
  To run this code you'll need a few (not very difficult to write, but important) extensions that are part of my LINQ Extensions
  project available at CodePlex. Finally, I'd like to give a credit to the authors of the F# language where this kind of expression
  processing is natively supported, because without my experiences with F# I probably wouldn't think of building queries in a way
  I present it in this article.
