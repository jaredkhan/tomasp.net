<p>Some time ago, I received my copies of <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong>. I started working on it back in May 2008 and as many people who had more experience with writing books told me, it took longer than I was expecting! Anyway, I have to say, it was worth it, holding the actual printed book with my name on the cover is just fantastic!</p>

<p>The goal of the book is to present functional programming concepts and ideas in a readable form. I wanted to create a book that will teach you how to <em>think functionally</em> without using the usual <em>shock therapy</em> that people usually feel when seeing functional programming for the first time. There are already a couple of reviews that suggest I was quite successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Functional Programming for the Real World, by Tomas Petricek and Jon Skeet, has been a very helpful book for moving to F# from C#, as the authors do a fantastic job of helping to explain the differences between OOP and FP. </em><br />

  </li>
  <li><em>This book isn’t just a simple introduction to programming in F#; it’s an introductory text on functional programming covering the many reasons why it is time for this programming paradigm to finally be accepted by mainstream programmers. And it also contains much more... </em><br />

<h2>Deal of the day (January 24)</h2>
<p>Finally, here is one great news if you're interested in getting the book! <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is Manning's Deal of the Day this Sunday, January 24. On this day, the print book is available for $20 from the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Manning website</a>, with code <code>dotd0124</code>.</p>
