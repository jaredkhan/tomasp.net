<p>It appears that I have been doing a lot more talking than writing in the last two months.
  I'm hoping to change this direction and I have two articles almost ready, so stay tuned!
  I was also posting all my interesting F# snippets to <a href="http://fssnip.net/authors/Tomas+Petricek">fssnip.net</a>,
  which has grown quite a bit since I announced it in the last blog post. Thanks to everybody
  who submitted their snippets already and I'm looking forward to more! By the way, you can
  now run snippets using <a href="http://tryfs.net/">tryfs.net</a> by clicking at 
  "Load in TryF#" button.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the queue with talk materials that I wanted to post on my blog 
  has grown to 3. I talked about F# in MonoDevelop in the <a href="http://weblog.savanne.be/376-fosdem-2011-mono-room-slides">Mono room at FOSDEM</a> in February, 
  then I did an online talk for the <a href="http://www.communityforfsharp.net/">Community for F# </a>.
  Finally, this week, I did a tutorial on F# with <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a>
  at QCon in London (to fill in for Michael Stal due to unexpected health reasons).</p>

<p>Before I move on to writing about my recent experiments with LINQ, you can find materials from
  all of the recent talks below... </p>

<h2>F# in MonoDevelop (Mono Room @@ FOSDEM)</h2>

<p>In the Mono room talk, I demonstrated that F# can now be used in MonoDevelop
  thanks to the F# plugin that I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-in-monodevelop.aspx">worked on recently</a>.
  (We still need to update the plugin to work with MonoDevelop 2.6 beta and contributors are welcome!)</p>
<p>To show some of the features of F# in MonoDevelop, I talked about areas where F# works very nicely including
  <strong>functional programming</strong> and composability; <strong>scripting and exploring</strong> 
  when working with external data sources or new .NET/Mono libraries and <strong>server-side programming</strong>
  (I believe there should be more server-side frameworks for F#!)

<p>In this talk for the <a href="http://www.communityforfsharp.net/">Community for F#</a>,
  I tried to explain what makes F# a great programming language for teaching. In summary,
  the reasons are that F# is close to mathematics and theory, but can be used for
  very practical programming at the same time. This means that teaching F# also teaches 
  students theoretical background. However, they can write exciting applications and
  gain skills valued by the real-world.</p>

<p>In the talk, I demonstrated one possible approach. We can start by writing
  simple mathematical expressions (such as high-school math) and then use exactly
  the same principles based on <em>expressions</em> and <em>composition</em> for 
  composing graphics. This can be even extended to 3D objects!</p>

<h2>F# Tutorial (QCon London)</h2>

<p>My most recent appearance was together with <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog">Phil Trelford</a>.
  We were asked to do an F# tutorial to fill in for Michael Stal. This means that we had one weekend to 
  get ready for the tutorial, but I believe that the tutorial went quite well.</p>
<p>We used approach that I used in <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my functional book</a> and
  started with some C# examples of functional programming style. Then we looked how to write the same
  thing in F# (which looks, of course, much nicer). We also did a large practical sample - starting
  from <em>domain modelling</em> using functional data types, looking at <em>testing</em> and ending
  with <em>reactive user interface</em> using Silverlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tutorial was mostly practical, so we had only 
    <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/raw/master/Talks%202011/F%23%20Tutorial%20(QCon%20London)/QCon%20Slides.pptx">a couple of slides</a> (PPTX),
    but you may still find some useful information there.</li>
  <li>In the first practical part, I demonstrated 
    <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/tree/master/Talks%202011/F%23%20Tutorial%20(QCon%20London)/FunctionalStructures">functional data structures</a> in
    C# and F#. Then we used them to model the point of sale domain and to 
    create a <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/tree/master/Talks%202011/F%23%20Tutorial%20(QCon%20London)/Checkout">Silverlight Checkout</a> application.
    You can get all demos as a <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/raw/master/Talks%202011/F%23%20Tutorial%20(QCon%20London)/qcon.zip">ZIP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During the tutorial, we mentioned that we're working on turning the material presented during
  the tutorial into a more comprehensive <strong>Functional Programming Training</strong> organized
  at <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a>. If you're interested in learning
  more, let me know! I'll definitely write about it on this blog when we have some public announcement ready.</p>
