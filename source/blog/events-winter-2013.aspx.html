<p>After a few years, I finally managed to find the time to attend the 
  <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/">MVP Summit</a> this year. The Summit is
  an annual event where people who are active in Microsoft technical communities come
  to the Microsoft headquarters to learn about new things (and, of course, tell them 
  how they should be doing their job :-)). The Summit is a great place to meet interesting
  people (so if you're reading this and will be there, definitely get in touch!)
</p>

<p>The good news - for those interested in F# - is that I'll be doing two F# talks 
  on the way. I'll stop in <strong>Boston</strong> on <strong>February 13</strong> and then in <strong>New York</strong> on <strong>February 25</strong>.
  I'll be talking about different topics (Google tells me that the distance is 
  <em>only</em> 216 miles!)

  <p style="text-align:left;">Domain-specific languages are a pattern for designing composable 
    and easy to use software libraries. F# excels at this task as it combines powerful types
    and functional constructs with a flexible syntax.

  <p style="text-align:left;">The F# asynchronous workflows is one of the killer features of F#. Even with the asynchronous
    programming support in C#, the F# model has still many things to offer, including powerful
    agent-based programming model. </p>

<h3><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp">F# Trainings and Tutorials in London and New York</a></h3>
<p>Aside from the US road trip, we also redesigned <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp">the F# training</a>
  that I do with Phil Trelford. The new training is a very pragmatic 2-day F# training
  where you'll learn about F# (in the first day) and then use it in practice for 
  data processing and concurrent programming - the two domains where F# excels.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Course in <strong>New York</strong> on <strong>29-30 April, 2013</strong></li>
    <li>Course in <strong>London</strong> on <strong>13-14 March, 2013</strong></li>    
  </ul>
<p>I'm pleased to offer a 10% discount to the readers of this blog - just send me an 
  email to <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>! We are also happy to do
  in-house or custom trainings. If you're interested, get in touch too.

<p>If you can make it to <strong>New York</strong> in April/May, you have a unique chance
to learn F# and look at some advanced topics in just 4 days. The course will be immediately
followed by <strong>Progressive F# Tutorials</strong>. This two day event packed with
3 hour tutorials by F# expers all around the world will take place on <strong>1-2 May</strong>.
The current schedule is not available yet, but <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/2012-progressive-f-tutorials-nyc">
check out the last year's line-up as a teaser</a>.

<h3><a href="http://softwareast.ning.com/events">How F# Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data</a></h3>
<p>
Finally, if you live near <strong>Cambridge, UK</strong>, you can come to my upcoming talk 
about <a href="https://github.com/zachBray/Funscript">FunScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Fsharp.Data/">F# Data</a> (in the 
new Microsoft Research building, close to the train station!) 
In the talk, I'll show how you can easily call REST APIs from F# using type providers
and how you can access WorldBank data, but with a slight twist. All the code will be fully translated
to JavaScript and will run in any web browser.</p>
