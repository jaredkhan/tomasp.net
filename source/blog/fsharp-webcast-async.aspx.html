<p>In this webcast, we'll look at improving the code for downloading and
  processing RSS feeds that I presented in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the second part</a> 
  (if you didn't see earlier parts, <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the first one</a> was an introduction to 
  basic functional ideas). The previous part demonstrated how to use .NET libraries
  and we implemented a simple <code>downloadUrl</code> function for obtaining content
  of from the web and we've also seen how to load the data into an XML document object
  and how to filter items. In this part, we'll modify the code to run asynchronously and 
  potentially in parallel. To use some of the functionality, you'll need to get 
  <code>FSharp.PowerPack.dll</code>, which is available with the VS 2008 installation or
  as a separated download for VS 2010 [<a href="#fswc_asy">4</a>].
</p>

<p>Now that we have the first version of the code, we can start <em>refactoring</em> it.
  I'm using the term in a slightly vague meaning - we're of course going to change the
  behavior of the code. We'll wrap it into F# <em>asynchronous workflow</em> to run
  without blocking threads and we'll also run multiple downloads in parallel. However,
  this can still be viewed as refactoring in some sense, because we're not changing
  the <em>core</em> behavior of the code. As you can see from the webcast, these kinds of
  refactorings are also very nicely supported by F# syntax...</p>

<h2>F# Webcast Series</h2>
<p>This webcast series follows the usual F# development process
  where you start with experimenting and writing an initial version of the solution interactively using the 
  F# interactive tool. In the later phase of the process, we modify the code to make it parallel and asynchronous
  and finally, we can also encapsulate it into a standard .NET library that's usable from C#. 
  Here is a list of all webcasts in the series:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">Part I. - Introducing functional concepts</a></strong><br />
    The first part introduces functional programming principles such as immutability, recursion and functions
    that take other functions as parameter (<em>higher order</em> functions). This can all be demonstrated in
    C# 3.0, so we start with C# and then look how the same concepts look in F#. Finally, the first part also
    shows functions for working with lists in F#.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">Part II. - Using standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    The second part demonstrates how we can use standard .NET libraries. It uses classes from <code>System.Net</code>
    and <code>System.Xml</code> to download content of a web page (RSS feed), load it into XML document and 
    process it to find only posts that contain some specified keyword.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>Part III. - Downloading web pages asynchronously</strong><br />
    The third part shows how to make the code from the part II. better. It introduces F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>
    that can be used for writing code that doesn't block a thread when waiting for the completion of some I/O request.
    This part also shows how to modify the code to download and process multiple feeds in parallel.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx">Part IV. - Developing standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    In the fourth part, we look how to encapsulate the functionality written in F# into classes. 
    We'll finally create a project (rather than just use F# scripts) and we'll wrap the code we wrote into
    a .NET class. We'll also look how to compile the project into DLL and how to use it from a simple C# web application.</li>
