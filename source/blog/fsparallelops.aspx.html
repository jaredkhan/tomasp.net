<h1>Keep your multi-core CPU busy with F#</h1>
<p>The growth of computer CPU speed is slowly being replaced by the growth of number of CPUs 
  (or cores) in the computer at least for the close future. This causes a revolution in the way software is 
  written, because traditional and most widely used way of writing concurrent applications using
  threads is difficult and brings several serious issues. Some predictions say that within a few
  years, almost every computer will have about 16 cores, so there is a huge need for programming
  paradigms or idioms that help developers write concurrent software easily (see also <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">The Free Lunch Is Over</a> 
  [<a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm" target="_blank">^</a>] written by Herb Sutter).</p>

<p>Functional programming languages (especially pure functional languages) are interesting from 
  this point of view, because the program doesn't have side-effects which makes it very easy to 
  parallelize it (programs in pure functional languages can't have any side-effects by design, in other functional

<h2>Finding primes example</h2>
<p>Let's say I want to find all prime numbers between 1 million and 1.1 million (this is example of
  an operation that can be nicely divided between more processors). First we will need function to test
  whether <code>n</code> is a prime:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
// Tests whether n is prime - expects n > 1
let is_prime n =
  // calculate how large divisors should we test..
  let max = int_of_float (Math.Sqrt( float_of_int n ))
  // try to divide n by 2..max (stops when divisor is found)
  not ({ 2 .. max } |> Seq.filter ( fun d -> n%d = 0) |> Seq.nonempty)
</pre>  
<p>To find all primes in the specified range we could use the following code:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let primes = [1000000 .. 1100000] |> List.filter is_prime
</pre>
<p>This code subsequently executes the <code>is_prime</code> function for all numbers that we want to test,
  but with multiple CPU cores it would be nice if the function divided the numbers into 
  several parts and executed every part on different thread, so application would take benefit from multiple
  cores available in the system. The <code>is_prime</code> function doesn't have any side-effects so 
  executing it several times in parallel can't change the result of operation (if the order of primes in the 
  returned list doesn't change). </p>

<p>I wrote a function that does exactly what I described in the previous paragraph. To execute the operation
  in parallel, you can use the following code (the only difference is that I replaced <code>List</code> module with
  my <code>ParallelList</code> module):</p>  
<pre lang="fsharp">
let primes = [1000000 .. 1100000] |> ParallelList.filter is_prime
</pre>

<p>On my notebook (with Intel Core Duo processor) the first code (using <code>List.filter</code>) takes about 
  <strong>2,3sec</strong> and using <code>ParallelList.filter</code> the operation takes only <strong>1.3sec</strong>.
  The program isn't 2 times faster, because there is some overhead for creating and synchronizing threads, but in 
  this case the speed increase is significant.</p>
  
<p>Aside from the <code>filter</code> function, the <code>ParallelList</code> module contains also the 
  <code>map</code> function (which does the same thing as the <code>List.map</code>). There is also
  a function <code>set_thread_count</code> that you can use to configure how many threads should be used when
  executing parallel operations (the default value is <code>2</code>).</p>  

<h2>Performance and future work</h2>
<p>The performance of these functions is the key issue. Currently the <code>ParallelList</code> functions work
  can't be used for small number of repetitions of simple function, because the overhead is larger than the profit
  from parallel execution. If the operation takes less than 0.01ms and the number of repetitions is less than 1000 
  the <code>List</code> functions are usually better, but for operations taking longer time the results of <code>ParallelList</code>
  are better even with smaller number of repetitions. For operation taking about 0.1ms the <code>ParallelList</code>
  gives better results for more than 200 repetitions and for operation taking more than 1ms the number of repetitions is 
  not very important (<code>ParallelList</code> is better even for 10 repetitions). These are inaccurate results that I got
  on my notebook, so if you're thinking of using the <code>ParallelList</code>, be sure to do some tests in your scenario!
  You can see some tests that I did in the demo project in <code>stats.fs</code> source file.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, <code>ParallelList</code> supports only <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> functions, so implementing
  more functions would be useful. It would be also useful to provide some alternatives for functions that can't
  be executed in parallel (like <code>fold_left</code>) that could be used in some situations. I'd also like to implement
  functions for working with other collection types like <code>Seq</code> (<code>IEnumerable</code>) and <code>array</code>
  in the future.</p>

<p>I'm interested in your ideas and suggestions, so if you find something that could be improved in the code,
  or if you have any other idea, let me know!</p>
