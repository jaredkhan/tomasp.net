 - description: The F# language combines the best from practice and academia. If you're working on interesting application of F#, have an experience worth sharing or some interesting research or idea, there are two workshops where you can share the idea with wider research and practitioner community, so consider submitting a talk!

<h1>F# in Academia: Present at upcoming events!</h1>
<p>The F# language was born as a combination of the pragmatic and real-world .NET 
platform and functional programming, which had a long tradition in academia. 
Many useful ideas or libraries in F# (like <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and 
<em>first-class events</em>) are inspored by research in functional programming
(namely, the work on <em>monads</em>, <em>continuations</em> and <em>functional reactive programming</em>).</p>

<p>Exchanging the ideas between the research community and the real-world is one
of the areas where F# excels. Indeed, the first applicatiosn of F# inside Microsoft
(in the Machine Learning group at Cambridge) were all about this - combining
research in machine learning with a language that can be easily used in practice.</p>

<p>However, F# and the F# users also made numerous contributions to the programming
language research community. Influential ideas that come from F# include 
<em>active patterns</em> and the F# style of <em>meta-programming</em> for translating F# to 
JavaScript). I think there is a lot more that the academic community can learn
from the F# community, so I'd like to invite you to talk about your ideas 
at two upcoming academic events!</p>

<h2>What, why, when, where and how!</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What?</strong> Do you have some interesting experience to report? Do you 
have an interesting F# DSL or novel application? Can you compare your experience with F#
and other languages? Or do you have some interesting extension for F#?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why?</strong> Collaboration between researchers and practitioners is just important!
Presenting your experience can influence researchers to improve languages
in a useful way. You can get useful feedback from people who think
about problems in a different, but interesting way!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When &amp; Where?</strong> Both of the events are co-located with ICFP 2012
in <strong>September 2012</strong> in <strong>Copenhagen</strong>. This is one of the largest functional
conferences, so you can learn about some interesting ideas from the
research world too!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How?</strong> Both of the events are quite informal, so you don't need to write
an academic paper! For CUFP, you just need talk abstract and for ML Workshop,
you need to write 2 page summary (see below for details).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial Uses of Functional Programming</h2>

</a>

<p>To quote the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/files/cufp-announcement.html">official CUFP announcement</a>, 
<em>"The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others are using functional 
programming to solve real world problems"</em>. The workshop is looking for presenters who have 
interesting experience with using functional programming in commercial sector. There 
are two kinds of talks, both should be about 25 minutes long:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Experience reports</strong> - explaining how you used functional programming in practice, 
what worked well and what were the difficulties; these talks can also discuss
interesting non-technical aspects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical talks</strong> - these talks should focus on some interesting technology 
or on some interesting application of functional programming. For example, how
to solve certain difficult problems, how to build scalable solutions etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For some inspiration, you can take a look at <a href="http://cufp.org/news/2012/cufp-2011-videos-and-scribe-report-now-available">videos from the last year</a>.
If you are interested in offering a talk, send an e-mail to <strong>sperber(at)deinprogramm(dot)de</strong> or
<strong>avsm2(at)cl(dot)cam(dot)ac(dot)uk</strong> by <strong>29 June 2012</strong> with a roughly 1 page description of what 
you'd like to talk about. If you want to discuss an potential F# topic informally first, 
get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>.</p>

<h2>ML Workshop</h2>

<p>The other event that may be interesting to F# programmers is Workshop on ML (see 
<a href="http://www.lexifi.com/ml2012/">official announcement</a>). Traditionally, the workshop 
has been focused mainly on research around ML, OCaml and F#. However, this year, it
also welcomes practical topics. To quote the announcement: <em>"This workshop aims to provide 
a forum where users, developers and researchers of ML languages and related technology 
can interact and discuss ongoing research, open problems and innovative applications."</em></p>

<p>You can contribute one of the following three kinds of talks:</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-academia/acm.jpg" class="rdecor" />

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research presentation</strong>  - describe new research related to ML (or F#), including
work in progress and outline of possible research directions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experience reports</strong> - present interesting story about an application of ML-style
language; this may include innovative or unexpected use of some interesting
aspects of the language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demos</strong> - demonstrations or short tutorials of new tools, libraries or applications
developed for, or using ML-style languages.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in presenting your ideas at the ML workshop, you should write a brief
description of the idea (up to 2 pages) and submit that to the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ml2012">submission web site</a>
before <strong>4 June 2012</strong>. Again, if you'd like to get some informal feedback before the
submission, feel free to get in touch: <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>.</p>
