<!-- [abstract]
<p>Quotation Visualizer is my tool that shows visual representation of F# quotations. Stephen noticed (Thanks!) that 
  Quotation Visualizer doesn't compile with the latest version of F# (1.1.13.8), so here is the updated version:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis-update/quotvis_bin.zip">Download executable</a> (51kB)</li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/quotvis-update/quotvis_src.zip">Download sources</a> (77kB)</li>
</ul>  
<p class="noindent">If you want to know more about this tool, here are links to previous articles about it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx">F# quotations visualizer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/quotvis-reloaded.aspx">F# quotations visualizer - reloaded!</a></li>
</ul>  

<h2>What was wrong?</h2>
<p>This tool is written using F# light syntax, which means that you don't have to write all the semicolons and
  F# compiler uses whitespace to determine end of the blocks (and some other constructs). This compiler option is
  relatively new so it is still evolving. First issue that I had is with class declaration - the following 
  code is not valid with the latest F# version:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
type MyForm = class inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
</pre>  
<p>I used it because it looks more familiar to C# developers :-). Instead of it you have to write the following:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
type MyForm = class 
  inherit Form as base
  // ...
end
</pre>  
<p>The second issue was with the pipeline operator which is useful when working with lists (or other sequences). The 
  correct syntax for using pipeline operator (for expressions that are longer than one line) is following:</p>
<pre lang="fsharp">
let filteredList = 
       oldArray
    |> Array.to_list 
    |> List.map ( fun m -> /* ... */ ) 
    |> List.filter ( fun m -> /* ... */ ) 
</pre>
