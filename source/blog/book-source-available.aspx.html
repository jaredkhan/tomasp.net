<p>As you can see, there has been quite a bit of silence on this blog for a while. 
  There are two reasons for that - the first is that I'm still working on the book 
  <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real World Functional
  Programming</a>, so all my writing activities are fully dedicated to the book. The second
  reason is that I'm having a great time doing an internship in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ppt">Programming Principles and Tools</a> group
  at Microsoft Research in Cambridge with the F# team and namely the F# language 
  designer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a>. 
  The photo on the left side is the entrance gate to the Trinity College of the Cambridge
  University taken during the few days when there was a snow. I recently started using
  Live Gallery, so you can find more photos from Cambridge in my <a href="http://cid-8c3f26b4befe2dfa.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20-%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">online gallery</a>. Anyway,
  I just wanted to post a quick update with some information (and downloads!) related
  to the book...

  I just wanted to post a quick update with some information (and downloads!) related
  to the book.

<h2>Get the source code</h2>
<p>When I started writing the book, I was using a pre-CTP version of the F# compiler,
  so the first few chapters needed a few minor updates and I had to convert the source
  code to the new <a href="http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!307.entry">project system</a>. 
  Since the book is currently going through the second review (an important milestone!), I finally
  did all the updates and so I can finally publish the source code. You can download the source 
  code for the whole book as well as for individual chapter. You can find all the details
  on the book web site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.functional-programming.net/source/allsources.zip">Download source code for all chapters</a> (150kB)</li>
  <li><a type="external" href="http://www.functional-programming.net/sources.aspx">Source code</a> for individual chapters (at www.functional-programming.net)</li>
</ul>  

<h2>Updated Table of Content</h2>
<p>Another news related to the book is that we're making a few changes in the table of content,
  especially in the last "applied" section. When I was thinking about the chapters originally, 
  I was mostly thinking about language features or libraries that are important and that should
  be discussed in the book. However, when looking for good samples and organizing them, I 
  realized that a much better approach is to group related technologies together in chapters
  that focus on a particular programming style.</p> 
<p>This means for example that <em>asynchronous workflows</em> are now in the chapter that 
  discusses <em>explorative programming</em>, because when working with data, we first need
  to obtain the data and that's exactly what asynchronous workflows are designed for! Another
  change is that there is a chapter about <em>reactive programming</em> that combines things
  that were originally distributed among about 4 chapters. Reactive programming is an important
  (and difficult!) problem that you face when writing applications that have to react to 
  multiple events or deal with asynchronous operations such as waiting for I/O, but also
  waiting for user actions.
  I added a new page to the <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="_blank">www.functional-programming.net</a>
  web site that contains the complete TOC with a brief explanation for every chapter:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a type="external" href="http://www.functional-programming.net/toc.aspx">Table of Content</a> - Real World Functional Programming</li>
</ul>
