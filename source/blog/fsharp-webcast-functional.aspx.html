 - description: Now that Visual Studio 2010 beta 1 is out, it may be a good time finally try the new F# language. To make the exploration easier, I created a web cast series that demonstrates interesting aspects of F#. In this part, we'll look at basic functional concepts and working with data.

<p>Now that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010/default.mspx" type="external">Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1</a> is out, it is finally a good time to take a look at 
  one of the (in my opinion) most interesting new features in the new release - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2009/05/20/visual-studio-2010-beta1-with-f-is-now-available-plus-matching-f-ctp-update-for-vs2008.aspx" type="external">the F# language</a>. F# existed for
  quite a long time now as Microsoft Research project, but is now becoming a real Microsoft product.
  Interestingly, F# is still available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=7bb32f32-9fac-4f34-ad56-b0bda130cf00" type="external">plugin for Visual Studio 2008</a>, so if you want to try it
  you don't have to install the whole new beta of 2010.</p>

<p>There are already many resources for learning F# including my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx">functional programming overview</a>,
  which is a Manning Greenpaper for the book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" type="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a> that I'm writing with Jon Skeet
  and my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">four-part F# introduction</a>. There are also some useful links on the 
  official <a href="http://www.fsharp.net">F# web site</a> including some talk recordings. However, I haven't yet seen any good F# webcast focusing 
  mainly on showing F# source code, starting from simple functional concepts to the real-world features like asynchronous workflows and object-oriented 
  programming in F#, so I decided to create one.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>This webcast is the first part of four that I'm planning. It follows the usual F# development process
  where you start with experimenting and writing an initial version of the solution interactively using the 
  F# interactive tool. In the later phase of the process, we modify the code to make it parallel and asynchronous
  and finally, we can also encapsulate it into a standard .NET library that's usable from C#. The first part of the 
  webcast introduces some basic functional ideas and F# concepts, but then we'll look at simple real-world example
  - we'll look how to download RSS feeds from the internet, process it in F# to find posts that are interesting
  for us and we'll use this F# library from C# web application. Here is a list of all webcasts in the series:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong>Part I. - Introducing functional concepts</strong><br />
    The first part introduces functional programming principles such as immutability, recursion and functions
    that take other functions as parameter (<em>higher order</em> functions). This can all be demonstrated in
    C# 3.0, so we start with C# and then look how the same concepts look in F#. Finally, the first part also
    shows functions for working with lists in F#.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">Part II. - Using standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    The second part demonstrates how we can use standard .NET libraries. It uses classes from <code>System.Net</code>
    and <code>System.Xml</code> to download content of a web page (RSS feed), load it into XML document and 
    process it to find only posts that contain some specified keyword.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">Part III. - Downloading web pages asynchronously</a></strong><br />
    The third part shows how to make the code from the part II. better. It introduces F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em>
    that can be used for writing code that doesn't block a thread when waiting for the completion of some I/O request.
    This part also shows how to modify the code to download and process multiple feeds in parallel.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:5px;"><strong><a href="/blog/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx">Part IV. - Developing standard .NET libraries</a></strong><br />
    In the fourth part, we look how to encapsulate the functionality written in F# into classes. 
    We'll finally create a project (rather than just use F# scripts) and we'll wrap the code we wrote into
    a .NET class. We'll also look how to compile the project into DLL and how to use it from a simple C# web application.</li>
