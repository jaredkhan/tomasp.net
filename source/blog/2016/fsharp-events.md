Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the [amazing Suave library](http://suave.io), playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler [called Fable](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable), or learning about the recent
features in [FsLab and Ionide](https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896), then
continue reading!

The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a [new awesome F# meetup there](http://www.fsharping.cz))
and my stop in Paris is attending [Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming](http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3) (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).

Workshops and trainings
-----------------------

I'm not going to say that one or two day F# event will make you an expert, but the [fsharpWorks
testimonials](http://fsharpworks.com/testimonials.html) say some very nice things about our trainings
and workshops. If you want to learn about F#, finance and web development, there are three upcoming
options.

### [Functional Web Development with F# and Suave](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/functional-web-development-with-f-and-suave-tickets-25477337402), 23 June, NYC

<img src="suave.png" style="float:left;width:100px;margin-top:30px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

One of the myths about F# and functional programming is that it is only good for complex
mathematics. This could not be further from truth and the [Suave project](http://suave.io)
enabled a lot of interesting use cases for F# on the web.

If you want to learn more, come to my hands-on F# workshop in New York! You'll learn about writing
asynchronous composable web servers and services with F#, but also about [more complex reactive
web applications](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets/).

 - The workshop is on _June 23_ in [Jet.com](http://jet.com) offices in _New York_
 - [Register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/functional-web-development-with-f-and-suave-tickets-25477337402)
   or [drop me an email](mailto:tomas@tomasp.net) for group booking or diversity discounts

### [FastTrack to F# in London](http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html), 30 June, London

<img src="sm.gif" style="float:left;width:100px;margin-top:30px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

FastTrack to F# is our [acclaimed](http://fsharpworks.com/testimonials.html) F# training that covers
everything ranging from the F# syntax and essential functional ideas to more advanced F# concepts.

In just two days, we'll look at a number of practical F# applications in areas such as data anlytics,
domain driven design, testing, asynchronous programming and concurrency.

 - The course is [at SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp) in _London_ on _30 June - 1 July_
 - [Drop me an email](mailto:tomas@tomasp.net) to get 10% discount or for in-house trainings

</div><div style="clear:both;"></div>

### [F# and Functional Programming in Finance](http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html), starting 6 June, Online

<img src="quantshub.jpg" style="float:left;width:80px;margin:10px;margin-top:40px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

If you are not close to London and New York, you can attend an online F# in finance training that
we did together with [QuantsHub](http://quantshub.com/content/f-and-functional-programming-finance).
This is 6-lecture course that you can take over 6 months, or at your own pace.

The course starts from
F# basics and focuses on topics relevant for financial computing with F# such as analyzing data
with FsLab, building domain-specific languages and integrating F# with larger .NET systems.

 - [Register at QuantsHub](http://quantshub.com/content/f-and-functional-programming-finance) for
   the self-paced or the 6-month version
 - [Drop me an email](mailto:tomas@tomasp.net) for in-house training requests

Conference and user-group talks
-------------------------------

Aside from the 3 workshops or trainings, I'll be also speaking at a couple of conferences and
user group events during the trip. I'm very happy to be coming to NDC Oslo again. It is a fun
conference and they also produce awesome recordings - you can catch some of the past talks by
[me and my fellow fsharpWorks colleagues here](fsharpworks.com/materials.html).

Aside from NDC and user groups, I'll be presenting [a paper on F# Data](http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/)
at the [PLDI 2016 conference](http://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2016) in Santa Barbara and
I'll be attending [Symposium for the History and Philosophy of Programming](http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3).
As you can see [from a few of my blog posts](http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/), this is a
recent interest of mine.

### [NDC Oslo: Data analysis with F#](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/analysing-big-time-series-data-in-the-cloud/), 10 June, Oslo

<img src="ndc.jpg" style="float:left;width:100px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

I'll be coming to NDC Oslo again, this time talking about some of the new technologies in
[FsLab](http://fslab.org), [Ionide](http://ionide.io) and [MBrace](http://www.mbrace.io/). You'll
see how F# lets you nicely scale the interactive and explorative programming style that makes
it so powerful from small data you can process locally to Big Data computations in the cloud.

### [F# SF: Celebrating New Year's eve with Suave](http://www.meetup.com/sfsharp/events/231315137/), 14 June, San Francisco

<img src="sfsharp.png" style="float:left;width:100px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

I'll talk about a [fun project I did for New Year's eve](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets/),
which tracks Happy New Year messages from all over the world on Twitter. The project was done using
[Suave](http://suave.io) and F# agents and it is a fun example of reactive and asynchronous web application.
If you are interested in reactive programming and web, this talk is for you!

### [F# Portland: Hacking web with Suave and Fable](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-F-Meetup-Group/), 20 June, Portland

<img src="fsharp.jpg" style="float:left;width:80px;margin:10px;" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

We are also planning an event at the F# meetup in Portland. This will be more hands-on and we will be
looking at all the new web libraries and tools that are available for F#. Aside from the
[Suave](http://suave.io) web server, we will also look at [Fable](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable)
which is a new F# to JavaScript compiler that integrates nicely with the modern JS ecosystem.

### [Haskell NYC: Coeffects & Context-aware programming](http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/), 22 June, NYC

<img src="bindny.jpg" style="float:left;width:80px;margin:30px 10px 10px 10px" />
<div style="margin-left:110px">

While in New York, I will be also visiting the [Haskell user group](http://www.meetup.com/NY-Haskell/)
to talk about my work on [coeffects](http://tomasp.net/coeffects). The details will appear on the
meetup page soon. Coeffects are the topic of my PhD thesis - it is a theory of capturing context
(say, physical context such as GPS sensors or printers) in programming languages. The formal model
of coeffects uses _comonads_, so even though I'm not an active Haskell programmer, this sounds
like a good fit for the Haskell meetup! In the meantime, check out my [interactive web page on
coeffects](http://tomasp.net/coeffects).
