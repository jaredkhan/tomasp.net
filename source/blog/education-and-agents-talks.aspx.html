 - description: This article contains materials for two talks that I had in November. First, I presented the F# plugin for MonoDevelop at the F# in Education workshop in Boston (using 3D functional library) and then I talked about agent-based concurrency (with Twitter and image processing examples) in London.

<p>November was quite a busy month for me. First, I traveled to Cambridge (the "new one" in
  Massachusetts :-)) to present my work on the F# plugin for MonoDevelop at the F# in Education workshop.
  Shortly after getting back to London, I started working on a presentation about Concurrent Programming

<p>Now that both of the events are over, I'd like to write a short summary and also finally

  Research group at MSR and SkillsMatter), so if you missed them, you can watch the recording...</p>

<p>Both of the events were really great and I had a chance to meet quite a few interesting people. 
  One of the things that make F# great is the community around it. I think that one unique aspect of the

  researchers as well as software developers and technical directors from the industry. This combination
  is really valuable for both sides. It helps to transfer ideas from research to practice it 
  gives researchers clear picture of problems in the industry that deserve their attention.</p>

<h2>Concurrent programming with agents</h2>

</a>

<p>My talk at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/">F#unctional Londoners meeting</a> focused
  on creating concurrent and reactive applications using the message-passing programming model based
  on agents using the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type in F#. This is a very attractive 
  model that can be used to write applications that need to handle multiple inputs coming from various
  sources and efficiently process them. Although I'm not an expert in the field, I can imagine it 
  could be great tool for writing trading systems. Here are some resources from the talk:</p>

    and come to our next meeting. There are some <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/ideas/542426/">interesting ideas</a> already!</li>
</ul>

<p>In the talk, I first introduced the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type and then used it to 
  implement a simple chat room. Then I used the <code>HttpListener</code> type to expose the chat room on web
  using a simple HTTP web server (in a Node.js style). Next we looked at more complicated agents for buffering
  incoming Twitter messages and agent for creating buffers in a pipeline processing of images.</p>

<h2>Going cross-platform with F# in MonoDevelop</h2>

</a>

<p>The main purpose of my <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/fsharpined/">F# in Education Workshop</a> talk was
  to present the F# plugin for MonoDevelop. However, I also used to talk to explain how F# (and the MonoDevelop plugin) can be 
  used in the academia. The three possible uses that I talked about are <strong>teaching</strong> (functional) programming, 
  <strong>data processing</strong> as part of research work and <strong>language research</strong> based on the open
  source F# stack. Here are materials from the talk:</p>

</ul>

  interested in using open source version of F# or contributing to the MonoDevelop plugin then you can also
