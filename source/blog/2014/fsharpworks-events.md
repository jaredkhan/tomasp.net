Welcome fsharpWorks!
--------------------

I have been doing a number of [F# trainings](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp),
talks and occasional F# consulting over the last few years. During that time, I had the pleasure of collaborating
with many great minds in the F# community, including [Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog/), 
[Mathias Brandewinder](http://www.clear-lines.com/blog/) and [Scott Wlaschin](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/).

At the same time, F# has seen an [explosive growth in 2013](http://www.eweek.com/developer/microsofts-f-language-number-12-with-a-bullet.html),
the number of [successful industrial users](http://fsharp.org/testimonials/) is growing at a steady rate
and there is a [great](https://github.com/fsharp/) [number](https://github.com/fsprojects/) of 
[interesting](https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/Deedle)
[open-source](https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider/) projects!
The demand for professional F# and functional-first trainings, consulting
and other services is also growing. So, to satisfy these needs, we decided to join forces
and form **fsharpWorks**!

#### What to expect from fsharpWorks?

 * At fsharpWorks, you can get a help from a team of F# experts who have years of experience
   solving real-world problems with F# in a range of areas & who also contribute to the core F# 
   open-source projects.

 * We offer a range of F# trainings focused on functional-first programming,
   domain modelling, machine-learning as well as finance. This includes the 
   [F# FastTrack course](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp) 
   with SkillsMatter and a number of new courses that will be announced soon.

 * We also provide in-house trainings based on your needs, consulting, support and other
   services with a guaranteed availability. If you need to grow a high-performing F# 
   team, or start an F# project on the right foot, [let us know!](mailto:info@fsharpworks.com)
   
 * Joining forces at fsharpWorks also makes it easier for us to speak at community events,
   conferences and to host affordable one day F# workshops. To see what is coming up soon,
   continue reading!
