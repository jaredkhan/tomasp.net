<p>Some time ago, I wrote an article about useful utility called <a href="http://www.tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx">F# quotations visualizer</a>.
  This utility can be used to show visual representation of F# quotations, that can represent (subset of) source code written in F#.
  There are two ways that you can use to get F# quotations - first is using operators <code>&lt;@@@@ ... @@@@&gt;</code> (this
  returns quotation of the code written inside the operator), second method is to get quotation of top level definition from compiled 
  F# assembly (you have to explicitly enable this using command line switch <code>--enable-quotation-data</code> while compiling assembly).
</p>
<p>Because I added several new features to the original Quotations visualizer, I decided to publish the latest version - here is the list of main improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewritten using active patterns (new F# language feature)</li>
  <li>It is possible to extract quotations from compiled F# assembly (if it contains quotation data)</li>
  <li>Added support for several missing language constructs</li>

<h2>Active patterns</h2>
<p>Active patterns is a new (experimental) feature in the F# language. You can find some information about this feature in 
  Don Syme's article [<a href="#qv-reload-links">1</a>]. In simple words, active patterns allows you to write "switch"
  consisting of functions (patterns) that return <code>'a option</code> type. When the code is executed, it finds first 
  pattern whose query returned a value (<code>Some(...)</code>) and the body of selected pattern is executed.</p>
<p>This feature makes it very easy to work with F# quotations because all <code>ef[Something]</code> values that are used
  for querying quotations have the required signature (the <code>Query</code> function that returns <code>'a option</code> type),
  so they can be used with the active patterns feature.</p>
<p>In the quotations visualizer, we need to match the expression (type <code>expr</code>) with all possible 
  expression families (<code>ef[Something]</code>) and choose the first one that matches. To see how active patterns
  work, you can look at the following part of the function that does this. First, without active patterns:</p>  
<pre>
<span class="k">match</span> efForLoop.Query(expr) <span class="k">with</span>
  | Some(nfrom,nto,body) -&gt;
      <span class="c">// Statement: for i=start to end do body; done;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | _ -&gt;
<span class="k">match</span> efWhileLoop.Query(cond,body) <span class="k">with</span>
      <span class="c">// Statement: while condition do body; done;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | _ -&gt;
<span class="k">match</span> efCond.Query(t,(cond,trbody,flbody)) <span class="k">with</span>
      <span class="c">// if (cond) then trbody; else flbody;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | _ -&gt;
      <span class="c">// unknown expression</span>
</pre>      
<p>And with active patterns the source looks like this:</p>
<pre>
#light
<span class="k">let</span> EFForLoop = efForLoop
<span class="k">let</span> EFWhileLoop = efWhileLoop
<span class="k">let</span> EFCond = efCond

<span class="k">match</span> expr <span class="k">with</span>
  | EFForLoop(nfrom,nto,body) -&gt;
      <span class="c">// Statement: for i=start to end do body; done;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | EFWhileLoop(cond,body) -&gt;
      <span class="c">// Statement: while condition do body; done;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | EFCond(t,(cond,trbody,flbody)) -&gt;
      <span class="c">// if (cond) then trbody; else flbody;
      // .. create tree node ..</span>
  | _ -&gt;
      <span class="c">// unknown expression</span>
</pre>      
<p>This is very simple example and there are many situations where active patterns are even more helpful.
  You may have also noticed that the code doesn't contain any semicolons. This is the result of another new feature called
  lightweight syntax (it is turned on by the #light directive) - if you turn it on the whitespace becomes significant
  and compiler can understand structure of the code using whitespace instead of semicolons, parentheses and 
  <code>begin</code>/<code>end</code> keywords. This feature is described in the F# manual [<a href="#qv-reload-links">2</a>].</p>

<h2>Extracting quotations from assembly</h2>
<p>When you specify <code>--enable-quotation-data</code> switch to the F# compiler, it stores quotation of every
  top level definition (functions in modules) in the assembly. This quotation can be later retrieved using 
  <code>resolveTopDef</code> function, however to use the function for loading top-level definitions from 
  another assembly, you first have to load quotation data from the assembly. The following snippet shows
  how to register declarations from assembly.</p>

<pre>
<span class="k">let</span> asm = Assembly.LoadFile(name) <span class="k">in</span>
  asm.GetManifestResourceNames() |&gt; Array.to_list 
    |&gt; List.filter (<span class="k">fun</span> rn -&gt; 
        rn.StartsWith(pickledDefinitionsResourceNameBase)) 
    |&gt; List.iter (<span class="k">fun</span> rn -&gt; 
        explicitlyRegisterTopDefs asm rn (readToEnd (asm.GetManifestResourceStream(rn))))
</pre>  
<p>This code first loads the assembly (using <code>LoadFile</code> method which accepts assembly file path).
  Than it gets all managed resources of the assembly and filters only those, which name starts with
  <code>pickledDefinitionsResourceNameBase</code> (this is a constant declared in <code>Microsoft.FSharp.Quotations.Raw</code> module).
  Now we have all resources containing F# quotation data, and we can use <code>explicitlyRegisterTopDefs</code> function
  to load quoted top level definitions. The <code>explicitlyRegisterTopDefs</code> method takes three parameters - 
  assembly, name of the resource and resource data (byte array). When the top level definitions are registered using 
  this method, it is possible to load quotations of functions declared in loaded assembly - and this is exactly what 
  happens when you click on the "Open F# assembly" link in the application.
  If you are interested in the complete code, look at the attached source code of quotations visualizer application.</p>
